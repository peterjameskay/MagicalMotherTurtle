Help! The Michigan Magical Mother Turtle needs your assistance! Swim around Lake Michigan and hatch her eggs.
The more eggs you hatch, the more your score goes up and the faster Mother Turtle goes! Make sure you don't 
go out of bounds, if you do, the game is over and you have to start all again! Just know that the mother's 
babies will still be there, if you decide to play again. Sometimes, the babies can hide the eggs! To move,
use "W,A,S,D"  (W = forward, A = left, S = backward and D = right). You can only move in 90 degrees angles!
Let me know if you have any suggestions or anything that I can add to make it better!
